# VisionQwen

![VisionQwen](assets/teaserimage.png)

A real-time AI assistant for Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses powered by **Qwen** (or any OpenAI-compatible API). See what you see, hear what you say, and take actions on your behalf — all through voice.

This is a fork of [VisionClaw](https://github.com/sseanliu/VisionClaw) with Gemini Live replaced by Qwen vision-language models via OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

![Cover](assets/cover.png)

Built on [Meta Wearables DAT SDK](https://github.com/facebook/meta-wearables-dat-ios) (iOS) / [DAT Android SDK](https://github.com/nichochar/openclaw) (Android) + Qwen VL API + [OpenClaw](https://github.com/nichochar/openclaw) (optional).

**Supported platforms:** iOS (iPhone) and Android (Pixel, Samsung, etc.)

## What It Does

Put on your glasses, tap the AI button, and talk:

- **"What am I looking at?"** -- Qwen sees through your glasses camera and describes the scene
- **"Add milk to my shopping list"** -- delegates to OpenClaw, which adds it via your connected apps
- **"Send a message to John saying I'll be late"** -- routes through OpenClaw to WhatsApp/Telegram/iMessage
- **"Search for the best coffee shops nearby"** -- web search via OpenClaw, results spoken back

The glasses camera streams at ~1fps to Qwen for visual context, while audio flows bidirectionally in real-time.

## How It Works

```

**Key pieces:**
- **Qwen VL API** -- vision-language model via OpenAI-compatible endpoint (DashScope, Ollama, or any compatible backend)
- **OpenClaw** (optional) -- local gateway that gives Qwen access to 56+ tools and all your connected apps
- **Phone mode** -- test the full pipeline using your phone camera instead of glasses
- **WebRTC streaming** -- share your glasses POV live to a browser viewer

---

## Quick Start (iOS)

### 1. Clone and open

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tr10ne/visionqwen.git
cd visionqwen/samples/CameraAccess
open CameraAccess.xcodeproj
```

### 2. Add your secrets

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp CameraAccess/Secrets.swift.example CameraAccess/Secrets.swift
```

Edit `Secrets.swift` with your Qwen API key and endpoint (required) and optional OpenClaw/WebRTC config:

```swift
static let geminiAPIKey = "YOUR_QWEN_API_KEY"
static let geminiBaseURL = "https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
// or "http://localhost:11434/v1" for local Ollama
static let geminiModel = "qwen-vl-max"
```

> **Note:** Field names in `Secrets.swift` remain as-is from the original codebase. Set `geminiAPIKey` to your Qwen API key and `geminiBaseURL` to your OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

Get a free API key at [DashScope](https://dashscope.aliyun.com/) or run locally via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

### 3. Build and run

Select your iPhone as the target device and hit Run (Cmd+R).

### 4. Try it out

**Without glasses (iPhone mode):**
1. Tap **"Start on iPhone"** -- uses your iPhone's back camera
2. Tap the **AI button** to start a Qwen session
3. Talk to the AI -- it can see through your iPhone camera

**With Meta Ray-Ban glasses:**

First, enable Developer Mode in the Meta AI app:

1. Open the **Meta AI** app on your iPhone
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon, bottom left)
3. Tap **App Info**
4. Tap the **App version** number **5 times** -- this unlocks Developer Mode
5. Go back to Settings -- you'll now see a **Developer Mode** toggle. Turn it on.

![How to enable Developer Mode](assets/dev_mode.png)

Then in VisionQwen:
1. Tap **"Start Streaming"** in the app
2. Tap the **AI button** for voice + vision conversation

---

## Quick Start (Android)

### 1. Clone and open

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tr10ne/visionqwen.git
```

Open `samples/CameraAccessAndroid/` in Android Studio.

### 2. Configure GitHub Packages (DAT SDK)

The Meta DAT Android SDK is distributed via GitHub Packages. You need a GitHub Personal Access Token with `read:packages` scope.

1. Go to [GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create a **classic** token with `read:packages` scope
2. In `samples/CameraAccessAndroid/local.properties`, add:

```properties
github_token=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

> **Tip:** If you have the `gh` CLI installed, you can run `gh auth token` to get a valid token. Make sure it has `read:packages` scope -- if not, run `gh auth refresh -s read:packages`.
>
> **Note:** GitHub Packages requires authentication even for public repositories. The 401 error means your token is missing or invalid.

### 3. Add your secrets

```bash
cd samples/CameraAccessAndroid/app/src/main/java/com/meta/wearable/dat/externalsampleapps/cameraaccess/
cp Secrets.kt.example Secrets.kt
```

Edit `Secrets.kt` with your Qwen API key and endpoint:

```kotlin
const val geminiApiKey = "YOUR_QWEN_API_KEY"
const val geminiBaseUrl = "https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
const val geminiModel = "qwen-vl-max"
```

> **Note:** Field names in `Secrets.kt` remain as-is from the original codebase. Set `geminiApiKey` to your Qwen API key and `geminiBaseUrl` to your OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

### 4. Build and run

1. Let Gradle sync in Android Studio (it will download the DAT SDK from GitHub Packages)
2. Select your Android phone as the target device
3. Click Run (Shift+F10)

> **Wireless debugging:** You can also install via ADB wirelessly. Enable **Wireless debugging** in your phone's Developer Options, then pair with `adb pair <ip>:<port>`.

### 5. Try it out

**Without glasses (Phone mode):**
1. Tap **"Start on Phone"** -- uses your phone's back camera
2. Tap the **AI button** (sparkle icon) to start a Qwen session
3. Talk to the AI -- it can see through your phone camera

**With Meta Ray-Ban glasses:**

Enable Developer Mode in the Meta AI app (same steps as iOS above), then:
1. Tap **"Start Streaming"** in the app
2. Tap the **AI button** for voice + vision conversation

---

## Setup: OpenClaw (Optional)

OpenClaw gives Qwen the ability to take real-world actions: send messages, search the web, manage lists, control smart home devices, and more. Without it, Qwen is voice + vision only.

### 1. Install and configure OpenClaw

Follow the [OpenClaw setup guide](https://github.com/nichochar/openclaw). Make sure the gateway is enabled:

In `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "port": 18789,
    "bind": "lan",
    "auth": {
      "mode": "token",
      "token": "your-gateway-token-here"
    },
    "http": {
      "endpoints": {
        "chatCompletions": { "enabled": true }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Key settings:
- `bind: "lan"` -- exposes the gateway on your local network so your phone can reach it
- `chatCompletions.enabled: true` -- enables the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint (off by default)
- `auth.token` -- the token your app will use to authenticate

### 2. Configure the app

**iOS** -- In `Secrets.swift`:
```swift
static let openClawHost = "http://Your-Mac.local"
static let openClawPort = 18789
static let openClawGatewayToken = "your-gateway-token-here"
```

**Android** -- In `Secrets.kt`:
```kotlin
const val openClawHost = "http://Your-Mac.local"
const val openClawPort = 18789
const val openClawGatewayToken = "your-gateway-token-here"
```

To find your Mac's Bonjour hostname: **System Settings > General > Sharing** -- it's shown at the top (e.g., `Johns-MacBook-Pro.local`).

> Both iOS and Android also have an in-app Settings screen where you can change these values at runtime without editing source code.

### 3. Start the gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:18789/health
```

Now when you talk to the AI, it can execute tasks through OpenClaw.

## Architecture

### Key Files (iOS)

All source code is in `samples/CameraAccess/CameraAccess/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Gemini/GeminiConfig.swift` | API keys, model config, system prompt |
| `Gemini/GeminiLiveService.swift` | WebSocket client for Qwen VL API (OpenAI-compatible) |
| `Gemini/AudioManager.swift` | Mic capture (PCM 16kHz) + audio playback (PCM 24kHz) |
| `Gemini/GeminiSessionViewModel.swift` | Session lifecycle, tool call wiring, transcript state |
| `OpenClaw/ToolCallModels.swift` | Tool declarations, data types |
| `OpenClaw/OpenClawBridge.swift` | HTTP client for OpenClaw gateway |
| `OpenClaw/ToolCallRouter.swift` | Routes tool calls to OpenClaw |
| `iPhone/IPhoneCameraManager.swift` | AVCaptureSession wrapper for iPhone camera mode |
| `WebRTC/WebRTCClient.swift` | WebRTC peer connection + SDP negotiation |
| `WebRTC/SignalingClient.swift` | WebSocket signaling for WebRTC rooms |

### Key Files (Android)

All source code is in `samples/CameraAccessAndroid/app/src/main/java/.../cameraaccess/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `gemini/GeminiConfig.kt` | API keys, model config, system prompt |
| `gemini/GeminiLiveService.kt` | OkHttp WebSocket client for Qwen VL API (OpenAI-compatible) |
| `gemini/AudioManager.kt` | AudioRecord (16kHz) + AudioTrack (24kHz) |
| `gemini/GeminiSessionViewModel.kt` | Session lifecycle, tool call wiring, UI state |
| `openclaw/ToolCallModels.kt` | Tool declarations, data classes |
| `openclaw/OpenClawBridge.kt` | OkHttp HTTP client for OpenClaw gateway |
| `openclaw/ToolCallRouter.kt` | Routes tool calls to OpenClaw |
| `phone/PhoneCameraManager.kt` | CameraX wrapper for phone camera mode |
| `webrtc/WebRTCClient.kt` | WebRTC peer connection (stream-webrtc-android) |
| `webrtc/SignalingClient.kt` | OkHttp WebSocket signaling for WebRTC rooms |
| `settings/SettingsManager.kt` | SharedPreferences with Secrets.kt fallback |

### Audio Pipeline

- **Input**: Phone mic -> AudioManager (PCM Int16, 16kHz mono, 100ms chunks) -> Qwen API
- **Output**: Qwen API -> AudioManager playback queue -> Phone speaker
- **iOS iPhone mode**: Uses `.voiceChat` audio session for echo cancellation + mic gating during AI speech
- **iOS Glasses mode**: Uses `.videoChat` audio session (mic is on glasses, speaker is on phone -- no echo)
- **Android**: Uses `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` audio source for built-in acoustic echo cancellation

### Video Pipeline

- **Glasses**: DAT SDK video stream (24fps) -> throttle to ~1fps -> JPEG (50% quality) -> Qwen VL API
- **Phone**: Camera capture (30fps) -> throttle to ~1fps -> JPEG -> Qwen VL API

### Tool Calling

Both apps declare a single `execute` tool that routes everything through OpenClaw:

1. User says "Add eggs to my shopping list"
2. Qwen speaks "Sure, adding that now" (verbal acknowledgment before tool call)
3. App sends `toolCall` with `execute(task: "Add eggs to the shopping list")`
4. `ToolCallRouter` sends HTTP POST to OpenClaw gateway
5. OpenClaw executes the task using its 56+ connected skills
6. Result returns via `toolResponse`
7. Qwen speaks the confirmation

### WebRTC Live Streaming

Share your glasses POV in real-time to a browser viewer with bidirectional audio and video.

1. Tap the **Live** button in the app
2. The app connects to a signaling server and gets a 6-character room code
3. Share the code -- the viewer opens the server URL in a browser and enters it
4. WebRTC peer connection is established (SDP + ICE via the signaling server)
5. Media flows peer-to-peer: glasses video to browser, browser camera back to iOS PiP

**Key details:**
- **Signaling server**: Node.js + WebSocket, located at `samples/CameraAccess/server/` -- serves the browser viewer and relays SDP/ICE
- **NAT traversal**: Google STUN servers + ExpressTURN relay (fetched from `/api/turn`)
- **Video**: 24 fps, 2.5 Mbps max bitrate
- **Background handling**: 60-second grace period for iOS app backgrounding -- room stays alive for reconnection
- **Constraint**: Cannot run simultaneously with an active AI session (audio device conflict)

For full details, see [`samples/CameraAccess/CameraAccess/WebRTC/README.md`](samples/CameraAccess/CameraAccess/WebRTC/README.md).

## Requirements

### iOS
- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Qwen API key ([DashScope](https://dashscope.aliyun.com/) or local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/))
- Meta Ray-Ban glasses (optional -- use iPhone mode for testing)
- OpenClaw on your Mac (optional -- for agentic actions)

### Android
- Android 14+ (API 34+)
- Android Studio Ladybug or newer
- GitHub account with `read:packages` token (for DAT SDK)
- Qwen API key ([DashScope](https://dashscope.aliyun.com/) or local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/))
- Meta Ray-Ban glasses (optional -- use Phone mode for testing)
- OpenClaw on your Mac (optional -- for agentic actions)

---

## Troubleshooting

### General

**AI doesn't hear me** -- Check that microphone permission is granted. Speak clearly and at normal volume.

**OpenClaw connection timeout** -- Make sure your phone and Mac are on the same Wi-Fi network, the gateway is running (`openclaw gateway restart`), and the hostname matches your Mac's Bonjour name.

**OpenClaw opens duplicate browser tabs** -- This is a known upstream issue in OpenClaw's CDP connection management ([#13851](https://github.com/nichochar/openclaw/issues/13851), [#12317](https://github.com/nichochar/openclaw/issues/12317)). Using `profile: "openclaw"` (managed Chrome) instead of the default extension relay may improve stability.

### iOS-specific

**"API key not configured"** -- Add your Qwen API key in Secrets.swift (`geminiAPIKey` field) or in the in-app Settings.

**Echo/feedback in iPhone mode** -- The app mutes the mic while the AI is speaking. If you still hear echo, try turning down the volume.

### Android-specific

**Gradle sync fails with 401 Unauthorized** -- Your GitHub token is missing or doesn't have `read:packages` scope. Check `local.properties`. Generate a new token at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

**API timeout** -- Ensure your `geminiBaseUrl` is reachable from your phone. If using Ollama locally, make sure it's bound to `0.0.0.0` and not just `localhost`.

**Audio not working** -- Ensure `RECORD_AUDIO` permission is granted. On Android 13+, you may need to grant this permission manually in Settings > Apps.

**Phone camera not starting** -- Ensure `CAMERA` permission is granted. CameraX requires both the permission and a valid lifecycle.

For DAT SDK issues, see the [developer documentation](https://wearables.developer.meta.com/docs/develop/) or the [discussions forum](https://github.com/facebook/meta-wearables-dat-ios/discussions).
